## Supported Markdown Features

The Confluence Integration plugin for Obsidian supports a variety of Markdown features, allowing you to create rich and interactive content in your Confluence pages. The following Markdown elements are supported:

### Blockquotes

Blockquotes are supported and can be created using the `>` character followed by the text you want to quote.

### Callouts

Callouts can be created using the [Callouts](./callouts.md) feature, which allows you to create custom, styled callout boxes in Confluence.

### Code

Code blocks and inline code can be created using triple backticks (\`\`\`) for blocks and single backticks (\`) for inline code.

### Diagrams (Mermaid.js)

Mermaid.js diagrams are supported through the plugin's Mermaid diagram feature, which renders diagrams as images in Confluence.

### Images (Image Upload Supported)

Image embedding and uploading are supported through the Image Upload feature. Images included in a page will be uploaded as attachments in Confluence. This includes support for transcluded images.

### Linking

- Wikilinks: The plugin supports basic Wikilinks functionality, allowing you to link to other files that are being published.
- Extenal links: Rendered as a Smart Link

### Headings

Headings can be created using the `#` character followed by the heading text. Multiple levels of headings can be created by using multiple `#` characters.

### Horizontal Bar

Horizontal bars can be created using three hyphens (`---`).

### Lists

Both ordered and unordered lists can be created using Markdown syntax.

### Text Formatting

- Strike-through: Text can be formatted with strike-through using double tildes (`~~`).
- Emphasis: Emphasis can be added using single (`*`) or double (`**`) asterisks for italic and bold formatting, respectively.

### Tables

Tables can be created using Markdown syntax with pipes (`|`) and hyphens (`-`) to define the table structure.

### Callouts

Callouts can be created using the [Callouts](./callouts.md) feature. This allows you to create custom, styled callout boxes in Confluence.
