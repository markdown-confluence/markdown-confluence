# Alternative Installation
Due to waiting for https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/pull/1867 to be merged.

If you would like to use the plugin currently you will need to use [Alternative Installation](./installation-brat.md) instructions.

# Installation
1. Install the `confluence-integration` plugin from Obsidian's community plugins browser.
2. Open the plugin settings and configure the following fields:
    - `Confluence Base URL`: The base URL of your Atlassian Confluence instance (e.g., `https://your-domain.atlassian.net`)
    - `Confluence Parent Id`: The Confluence page ID where your notes will be published as child pages
    - `Atlassian User Name`: Your Atlassian account's email address
    - `Atlassian API Token`: Your Atlassian API token. You can generate one from your [Atlassian Account Settings](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).
    - `Folder To Publish`: The name of the folder in Obsidian containing the notes you want to publish (default: "Confluence Pages")
