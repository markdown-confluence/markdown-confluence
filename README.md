Welcome to the `Markdown to Confluence Tools` project! This mono repository contains a collection of tools to convert and publish your Markdown files to Confluence, while using the Atlassian Document Format (ADF). We provide you with an Obsidian plugin, an npm CLI, a Docker CLI, a GitHub Action, and an npm library.

We focus on providing an opinionated, simple publishing workflow, with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as the recommended editor. However, you can use our tools with any Markdown files.

All projects within this mono repo use the core npm library [@markdown-confluence/lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@markdown-confluence/lib) to provide the same features, ensuring consistent results across different interfaces.
